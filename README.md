Melt.js

Javascript library inspired by the [R reshape](https://github.com/hadley/reshape) package by Hadley Wickham.

Melt is currently the only method provided by this library. How does it work?

First, it presumes you have your data in the form of a list of objects. That looks like this:

```js
var data = [
  {key1: 1, key2: 2},
  {key1: 2, key2: 3},
  {key1: 3, key2: 5},
];
```

But if you need the keys to be represented as a value, then melt can come to the rescue. Let's take a look at some examples:
